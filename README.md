# Movies-ETL

## IMPORTANT NOTE
I couldnÂ´t upload the meta data csv since it was too heavy for Github.

## Overview of the project
We did the Extract- Transform-Load (ETL) on a movie database for a company named Amazing Prime.  
Amazing prime wants to give the cleaned data to the contestants of an intern  contest.

## Results
To accomplish this task we needed to export our cleaned data to Postgres and go through the number of rows.  
This is the results for both, movies and ratings tables.
